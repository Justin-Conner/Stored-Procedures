In Visual Basic (VB) Web Forms, a control refers to a user interface element that you can add to a web page to interact with users or display information. Controls allow you to build interactive and dynamic web applications by providing various functionalities and features. VB Web Forms use a drag-and-drop approach to add controls to the web page and then customize their properties and behavior through code.

There are two types of controls in VB Web Forms:

HTML Controls:

HTML controls are standard HTML elements that you can place on the web page. They are represented by HTML tags like <input>, <button>, <label>, etc.
These controls are part of the System.Web.UI.HtmlControls namespace.
HTML controls don't have server-side events, meaning they trigger only client-side events and are not directly accessible on the server side. However, you can still access their values and properties on the server side using JavaScript or Request.Form collection.
Examples of HTML controls include textboxes, buttons, checkboxes, radio buttons, and dropdown lists.
Web Controls:

Web controls are more feature-rich and provide both client-side and server-side events and properties.
They are part of the System.Web.UI.WebControls namespace.
Web controls render as HTML elements but are enriched with additional features and are tightly integrated with the server-side code.
Web controls offer a wide range of functionalities and events, such as data binding, validation, paging, and more.
Examples of web controls include the GridView, TextBox, Button, DropDownList, Calendar, and many others.
When using VB Web Forms, you can simply drag and drop these controls from the Toolbox pane onto the design surface of your web form. Once added, you can customize their appearance, behavior, and other properties using the Properties window or by writing code in the code-behind file.

For example, you can create a simple web form with a TextBox control, a Button control, and a Label control. When the user enters text in the TextBox and clicks the Button, the Label will display a message based on the input. This functionality can be achieved through event handlers and server-side code.
